### Overview of the Project

Your project appears to be an AI-powered research assistant that processes PDF documents, extracts text, tables, and images, and builds a FAISS index for efficient retrieval. The system uses a Streamlit interface to interact with users, allowing them to upload research papers and ask questions related to the content of these papers.

### Key Components

1. **utils.py**: Contains utility functions for generating filenames, expanding queries using WordNet synonyms, and defining keywords for full context queries.

2. **main.py**: Handles the processing of PDF files, including text extraction, table extraction, image extraction, and building the FAISS index.

3. **app.py**: The main application file that sets up the Streamlit interface, manages user interactions, and generates answers to user queries using the FAISS index and a language model.

4. **extract_text.py**: Contains functions for extracting text, tables, and images from PDF files.

5. **vector_store.py**: Manages the creation and loading of FAISS indexes, encoding text chunks, and searching the index for relevant information.

6. **qa_system.py**: Handles the generation of answers to user queries using a language model (Gemini) and a retrieval pipeline.

### Potential Improvements and Features

1. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling in the PDF processing and FAISS index building stages to ensure robustness.

2. **Query Expansion**: Improve the query expansion logic to include more sophisticated NLP techniques for better context understanding.

3. **User Interface**: Enhance the Streamlit interface to provide better feedback to users, such as progress indicators during PDF processing.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the FAISS index building and searching processes to handle larger documents more efficiently.

5. **Security**: Ensure that sensitive information, such as API keys, is handled securely and not hardcoded in the source code.

6. **Documentation**: Add detailed documentation and comments to the code to improve maintainability and understandability.

### Next Steps

1. **Code Review**: Conduct a detailed code review to identify specific areas for improvement.

2. **Feature Implementation**: Prioritize the features you want to add or improve and start implementing them.

3. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the new features and improvements to ensure they work as expected.

Would you like to focus on a specific area first, or should we proceed with a comprehensive review and improvement plan?
