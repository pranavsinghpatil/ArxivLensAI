hello this the full fledged project 

##1️⃣ AI-Powered Personal Research Assistant 🧠 (Turns research papers into an interactive Q&A system)

🔥 Next Steps (What We Will Implement)

- 1]cc UI (Streamlit) for PDF Upload & Query Input    

- 2]cc Extracting Tables, Figures & Diagrams from PDFs (Not just text)

3] Integrating LangChain for Query Processing

4] Refining Answer Generation & Explanation System

5] Connecting Everything (Ensuring All Parts Work Together)

📌 Next Step: What Do You Want to Enhance?
Here are some possible upgrades—you can choose which ones to prioritize:

🔹 1. Improve Answer Quality

Fine-tune FAISS retrieval to get more relevant chunks

Improve prompting for Gemini/Hugging Face to give structured answers

Use a better model (gemini-1.5, mistral, gpt-4-turbo)


🔹 2. Enhance UI (Streamlit)

Better visualization of extracted images & tables

Option to highlight text in retrieved chunks

Add a “Download Answer” button


🔹 3. Add Summarization of the Research Paper

Generate concise summaries using Flan-T5 or Gemini

Auto-generate “Key Takeaways” for each section


🔹 4. Improve Speed & Performance

Optimize FAISS indexing to reduce processing time

Enable GPU for retrieval & answer generation

Cache embeddings to avoid recomputation
